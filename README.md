Simply comparing the monthly rent of a property against the monthly mortgage payments of a bought home is a flawed way to assess the costs of a property. Both renting and owning carry unrecoverable costs. In the case of renting, this is simply the rent. In the case of owning, the calculation is slightly more complicated, but it does not simply boil down to the mortgage payments. The Renting vs Buying Calculator is a shiny dashboard where users can easily introduce data about the properties they potentially want to buy and assess the unrecoverable costs of owning.

Why this Calculator?
There are many available online calculators to estimate whether it is better to rent or buy a home. Nonetheless, there are three main reasons why this calculator is still useful:
1. It provides specific information about the Dutch real estate market and taxes.
2. It is streamlined and more simple than other popular online rent vs buy calculators, such as [The New York Time's](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html). These calculators ask too many input variables from the user which only slightly improve the calculation outcome.
3. It provides empirically-informed default values for the calculator's parameters and cites their sources. Most online calculators expect the user to introduce complicated figures about expectations of future returns. Meanwhile, they often provide misguided default values and rarely cite their sources. This calculator allows users to assess what input parameters are sensible, and understand where they come from.
